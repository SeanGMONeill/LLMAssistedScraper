#### Gregory Maguire

Author of Original Novel

Gregory had written a dozen novels for children before launching his first
adult novel, _Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West_. A
devotee of children’s fantasy, Gregory’s subsequent novels for adults are
variations on-a-theme: _Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister_ considers
Cinderella as a seventeenth-century maid from Haarlem; _Lost_ evokes the ghost
of Charles Dickens’ _Scrooge_ and _Mirror Mirror_ concerns a High Renaissance
Snow White trapped in a household governed by the scheming Borgias. Gregory’s
latest novel, _Elphie, A Wicked Childhood_ , is inspired by a few passages
excised from his original novel first published three decades ago. Gregory’s
novel _Wicked_ is now followed by subsequent volumes in _The Wicked Years_
sequence: New York Times bestsellers _Son of a Witch, A Lion Among Men_ and
the final volume, _Out of Oz_.
